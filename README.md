<p>Euler discovered the remarkable quadratic formula:</p>
<p class="center">$n^2 + n + 41$</p>
<p>It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive integer values $0 \le n \le 39$. However, when $n = 40, 40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41$ is divisible by 41, and certainly when $n = 41, 41^2 + 41 + 41$ is clearly divisible by 41.</p>
<p>The incredible formula $n^2 - 79n + 1601$ was discovered, which produces 80 primes for the consecutive values $0 \le n \le 79$. The product of the coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.</p>
<p>Considering quadratics of the form:</p>
<blockquote>
$n^2 + an + b$, where $|a| &lt; 1000$ and $|b| \le 1000$<br /><br /><div>where $|n|$ is the modulus/absolute value of $n$<br />e.g. $|11| = 11$ and $|-4| = 4$</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Find the product of the coefficients, $a$ and $b$, for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for consecutive values of $n$, starting with $n = 0$.</p>

The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.
